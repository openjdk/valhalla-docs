# Project Valhalla

Project Valhalla is augmenting the Java object model with *value objects*,
combining the abstractions of object-oriented programming with the performance
characteristics of simple primitives. Supplementary changes to Java's generics
will carry these performance gains into generic APIs.

This Project is sponsored by the
[HotSpot Group](http://openjdk.org/groups/hotspot).

## JEPs

Valhalla project features will be added to Java over multiple releases.
This process is [managed with JEPs](https://openjdk.org/jeps/1),
each of which facilitates the development and integration into the JDK of a
cohesive set of changes.

There are four distinct feature sets under development:

1.  *[Value Classes and Objects](https://openjdk.org/jeps/401)*, introducing
    objects that lack identity and thus can have optimized encodings

2.  *Null-Restricted and Nullable Types*, providing language support for
    null-aware types and run-time enforcement of null restrictions

4.  *Unifying Primitives and Classes* with improved use of boxing for method
    invocations and generics, and custom conversions and operators for value
    classes

5.  *Parametric JVM*, preserving and optimizing generic class and method
    parameterizations at run time

We've also worked on some supplementary tasks and features, including:

-   [JEP draft: Strict Field Initialization in the JVM](https://openjdk.org/jeps/8350458)
    (in progress)

-   [JEP 390: Warnings for Value-Based Classes](https://openjdk.org/jeps/390)
    (delivered in 16)

-   [JEP 371: Hidden Classes](https://openjdk.org/jeps/371)
    (delivered in 15)

-   [JEP 334: JVM Constants API](https://openjdk.org/jeps/334)
    (delivered in 12)

-   [JEP 309: Dynamic Class-File Constants](https://openjdk.org/jeps/309)
    (delivered in 11)

-   [JEP 181: Nest-Based Access Control](https://openjdk.org/jeps/181)
    (delivered in 11)

## Implementation

Development takes place in a public OpenJDK repository, with occasional
early-access builds being published.

Interested developers are encouraged to experiment with these early releases.

-   [Early Access Documentation](early-access)
-   [Early Access Builds](https://jdk.java.net/valhalla/)
-   [GitHub repository](https://github.com/openjdk/valhalla)

Branches in the repository include `lworld` (the main line of Valhalla
development), `master` (tracking mainline OpenJDK), and various others
prototyping proposed features.

We welcome input from interested Java developers. Keep in mind that most
theoretical ideas have been well explored over the last few years! The greatest
help can be provided by those who try out concrete prototypes and can share
their experiences with real-world code bases.
